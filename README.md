## Deploy

_Assumes the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com) is installed and authenticated_

If you've never deployed to Heroku before, you'll need to setup the Heroku git remote first. From the project directory:

```shell
$ heroku git:remote -a spreedly-engineering-staging -r staging
$ heroku git:remote -a spreedly-engineering -r prod
```

### Deploy to staging

When you're ready to deploy, you can run this:

```shell
$ git push staging master
```

To view the staging docs go to http://spreedly-engineering-staging.herokuapp.com/, or invoke `$ heroku open -r staging`.

### Deploy to production

This is the same as deploying to staging, except the command looks like this:

```shell
$ git push prod master
```

After deploying, the site should then be visible at https://engineering.spreedly.com.
